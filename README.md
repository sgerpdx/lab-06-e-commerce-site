# E-Commerce Site Lab -- Day One/Lab 06

## Outcome:

The desired outcome at this point is a product page into which new products can be added from product data, using a JS 'render' function.

## HTML plan:

* Create a main 'storefront' page with a link to a second HTML product page;
* The product page is where items for sale will be listed, but this data will be appended via a button, in JavaScript;
* Create a section and div structure to house an unordered list <ul> into which the appending will occur.

## Javascript Plan:
<!-- * Create a render file for the function, and a separate data file in which to store product information in an object array.
    - Render-function components for each key-value pair in the object:
        - Create an HTML element, e.g. h2 or li, in a const variable;
        - Add to the classList for the element
        // need to review what the above step is doing, descriptively //
        - Edit the text content for the element
        - append this element/variable to the list
    - Create a button -->
